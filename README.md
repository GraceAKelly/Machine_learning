This repository contains a jupyter notebook analysing the Boston House price dataset using Python, packages scipy and keras. The notebook uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston House Prices dataset. Inferential statistics are used to analyse the difference in median house prices along the Charles river and houses which are not. Keras has been used to create a neural network to predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset.

## Getting Started

To deploy the analysis of the Boston House Price Dataset in the jupyter notebook select run all cells. The notebook is self contained for completion of anysis with no user input required. Descriptive and inferential statistics are analysed and explained within the notebook.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this notebook the following prequisites are required:

```
Python
Numpy
Seaborn
Pandas
Sklearn
scipy.stats as stats
Statsmodels
Matplotlib
Keras
```

## Versioning

Keras version 2.3.0 was used. Multi-backend Keras is superseded by tf.keras.
